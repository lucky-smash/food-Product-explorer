You’re continuing my project in /Users/admin/food-Product-explorer (backend). Current state:

Backend setup:
- server.js uses Express, dotenv, mongoose, cors, routes:
  - /api/products -> productRoute
  - /api/auth -> authRoute
- MongoDB Atlas connected via MONGO_URI in backend/.env
- JWT_SECRET set in backend/.env
- package.json has "type": "module"
- server runs on PORT (default 5000)

Models:
- backend/models/product.js:
  fields: name (required), brand, category, imageUrl; timestamps true
- backend/models/user.js:
  fields: name, email (unique, lowercase), password; timestamps true

Controllers:
- backend/controllers/productController.js:
  getProducts, getProductById, createProduct, updateProduct, deleteProduct
- backend/controllers/authController.js:
  register and login (bcrypt hash with salt rounds 10, JWT sign with expiresIn 7d)

Routes:
- backend/routes/productRoute.js:
  GET /, POST / (protected with authMiddleware), GET /:id, PUT /:id, DELETE /:id
- backend/routes/authRoute.js:
  POST /register, POST /login

Middleware:
- backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js
  reads Authorization: Bearer <token>, verifies JWT, sets req.user, calls next()

How auth/authorization currently works:
- Register/login returns a JWT token.
- Token must be sent in headers for protected routes:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
- authMiddleware blocks requests without valid token.

Working:
- CRUD works with Postman.
- Auth works; token returned on register/login.
- Protected POST /api/products requires token and works.

Notes:
- Health route is commented out in server.js.
- Some files have extra comments/indentation (not critical).

Next steps I want:
- Re-explain auth flow and how middleware + JWT protects routes (I was confused).
- Improve validation/error handling.
- Add authorization features (roles/permissions) after understanding auth.

Helpful reminders:
- To run server: in backend/ use `npx nodemon server.js`
- Login endpoint: POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
- Register endpoint: POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
- Products base: http://localhost:5000/api/products

Auth flow recap (simple):
1) User logs in -> server returns JWT token.
2) Client sends token in header on protected routes.
3) authMiddleware verifies token -> allows or blocks request.

Project goal (user intent):
- Build a full-stack project for resume.
- Current frontend uses public food API.
- Now integrating backend + OpenAI API.
- Planned features: dashboard to add restaurants/products, voice-to-text search.
- Wants step-by-step guidance to avoid confusion and grow features gradually.
